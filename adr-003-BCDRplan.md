# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan

## I. Executive Summary

This document outlines the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plan for the APIs supporting our banking system deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The primary goal of this plan is to ensure the availability, integrity, and resilience of these critical services in the event of disruptions or disasters.

## II. Objectives

The BCDR plan for our banking system APIs aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. Ensure high availability and reliability of the APIs to minimize downtime and data loss.
2. Define clear recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO) for different scenarios.
3. Establish comprehensive disaster recovery procedures to restore services quickly.
4. Regularly test and validate the BCDR plan to ensure its effectiveness.

## III. Scope

The scope of this plan includes the following components:

- **API Services**: The APIs supporting our banking system.
- **Data Storage**: Relevant data stores, databases, and data backups.
- **AWS Infrastructure**: The AWS environment where the APIs are hosted.

## IV. BCDR Strategies

### 1. High Availability

- Utilize AWS Auto Scaling to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.
- Deploy APIs across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to enhance redundancy.

### 2. Data Backups

- Implement regular automated backups of critical data, databases, and configurations.
- Store backups in a separate region to ensure data durability.

### 3. Disaster Recovery

- Define disaster recovery playbooks for common scenarios (e.g., infrastructure failure).
- Establish a process for declaring a disaster and initiating the recovery plan.
- Regularly review and update the disaster recovery procedures.

## V. RTO and RPO

Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for our APIs are as follows:

- **RTO**: Target to recover APIs within 4 hours after a disaster.
- **RPO**: Target to minimize data loss to less than 1 hour in case of a disaster.

## VI. BCDR Procedures

### A. High Availability Procedures

1. **Scaling**: Use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of API instances based on demand.
2. **Redundancy**: Deploy APIs in multiple AZs to ensure redundancy and failover capabilities.
3. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor service health and resource utilization.

### B. Data Backup Procedures

1. **Regular Backups**: Schedule automated backups of critical data and databases.
2. **Data Retention**: Define data retention policies for backups.
3. **Validation**: Periodically test and validate the backup and restoration process.

### C. Disaster Recovery Procedures

1. **Disaster Declaration**: Define criteria for declaring a disaster and appoint responsible personnel.
2. **Recovery Team**: Establish a recovery team with predefined roles and responsibilities.
3. **Recovery Playbooks**: Execute predefined disaster recovery playbooks for different scenarios.
4. **Communication**: Establish communication channels and procedures to keep stakeholders informed.

## VII. Testing and Validation

Conduct regular BCDR testing and validation exercises to ensure the plan's effectiveness and the team's readiness.

## VIII. Training and Awareness

Ensure that all relevant personnel are trained on their roles and responsibilities in the BCDR plan.

## IX. Maintenance and Review

Regularly review and update the BCDR plan to account for changes in the environment, technology, or business requirements.

## X. Contact Information

Maintain an up-to-date contact list of key personnel involved in the BCDR plan.

## XI. Appendices

Include any relevant diagrams, flowcharts, and technical documentation that support the BCDR plan.

By following this BCDR plan, we aim to maintain the availability and integrity of our banking system APIs, even in the face of unforeseen disruptions or disasters. Regular testing and updates are critical to ensuring its ongoing effectiveness.
